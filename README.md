# Artificial_Intelligence
This repo demonstrates the knowledge base to understand basics of Artificial Intelligence.

It has course material designed as per the S.E. Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, SPPU, Pune.

## Course Objectives:

To introduce fundamental concepts and techniques in Artificial Intelligence.

To enable students to implement key AI algorithms for search, reasoning, and learning.

To develop practical skills in solving real-world problems using AI.

To provide foundational knowledge in neural networks and decision-making systems.

## Course Outcomes: 

**CO1**: Apply rule-based systems and search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*) to solve structured problem-solving tasks.

**CO2**: Design and implement solutions for constraint satisfaction problems using backtracking and constraint propagation.

**CO3**: Develop intelligent agents for decision-making in games using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning techniques.

**CO4**: Construct and analyze basic neural network models for classification tasks, including the use of activation functions.
